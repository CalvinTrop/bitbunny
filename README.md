Thanks all!

bitBunny is my take on something I could cobble together out of mostly spare parts around my bench and some plastic off
my 3d printers. The goal is specifically NOT to have a billion features planned right off the bat, but to start slow and
simple, learn some OLED libraries/pixel art techniques, and generally just have fun hacking around with something I
could throw in my pocket headed out for a slow day in the field or poke at on the couch in the evenings. Maybe someday
it'll have a few of the fun features I would like to make that would be *useful*, but until then all you'll find here is
a scrap tamagotchi wannabe. And that's just fine with me. :)

Also need to get out of the way here that I'm in dire need of updating my git/python skills, and I generally work in a
very messy way on the command line, so there may be a lot of questionable code practice and some cleanup work to do in
the repo. You'll live.

ToDo: Finish this README, I'm tired and need a drink.

Requirements (as far as I can recall... :/):
  - i2ctools
  - python3-full
  - python3-smbus
  - python3-setuptools
  - pip
  - [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  - Adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306 lib
  - Adafruit-Blinka lib

The service related files and .env are here as backups and because I'm very lazy.
